Install from the command line

If you don’t want to use the starter, you can start from scratch and just install this theme from the command line.

Create a new Hugo site and initialize your project as a Hugo module:

hugo new site my-awesome-blog
cd my-awesome-blog
hugo mod init

Edit your config.toml to add the theme settings:

# Novela settings
theme = "github.com/forestryio/hugo-theme-novela"

paginate = 6

[social]
twitter= "https://twitter.com/forestryio"
github= "https://github.com/forestryio/novela-hugo-starter"
linkedin= "https://www.linkedin.com/company/forestry.io"
instagram = "#"
dribbble = "#"
youtube = "#"

[taxonomies]
author = "authors"

Create your first draft post and preview it locally:

hugo new post/my-first-post.md
hugo server -D

You’re good to go!
Customization
Logo

Override /themes/novela/layouts/partials/icons/ui/logo.html with your own file at /layouts/partials/icons/ui/logo.html; include your logo in SVG format for desktop and mobile formats.

Novela supports light and dark mode. To have your logo respond in kind, add class="change-fill" to the svg path(s).

In order for the Socials to be surfaced in Forestry, you should copy the theme’s config/_default/social.yaml to your project.
Authors

You should register authors as a taxonomy in your project’s `config.yaml``

taxonomies:
  author: authors
