# Blog-Archive

This is an archive of Doctopus blog using hugo-theme-novela. 

https://hugo-novela-forestry.netlify.app/
https://github.com/forestryio/hugo-theme-novela

This repo may be repurposed to collect all previous versions of the personal blog.

The personal blog workflow no longer uses this, instead it is implemented from the doctopus.github.io repo using github actions. This repo may be repurposed for other blog development. 

The previous workflow had the super directory blog as one repo and the hugo blog doctopus within it as another repo which used to be developed locally and pushed; then to keep an archive of all files associated with the blog the super-directory as also made into a repo. 

Note that inside doctopus folder there is a submodule from the doctopus.github.io repo and the hugo novela theme; first of which mmay not be updated anymore.
