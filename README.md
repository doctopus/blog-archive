# blog

This is an archieve of Doctopus blog using hugo-theme-novela. May be reporpused.

The personal blog workflow no longer uses this, instead it is implemented from the doctopus.github.io repo using github actions. This repo may be repurposed for other blog development. 

The previousl workflow had the super directory blog as one repo and the hugo blog doctopus within it as another repo which used to be developed locally and pushed; then to keep an archieve of all files associated with the blog the superdirectory as also made into a repo. Note that inside doctopus folder there is a submodule from the novela theme.
